# CryptoClustering
Module 19
## Overview
Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies that use cryptography for security. They operate on decentralized networks based on blockchain technology, which functions as a distributed ledger maintained by a network of computers (nodes). Cryptocurrency prices are highly volatile, making it essential to understand the factors influencing price changes.

This project explores the impact of price changes over different time periods using unsupervised learning techniques. The goal is to test and predict how cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour and 7-day price variations.

## Project Structure
The project is implemented in Python, utilizing unsupervised learning methods to analyze cryptocurrency price changes.

## Folder/file Breakdown
- Resouces/crypto_market_data.csv: The dataset used for prediction.
- Crypto_Clustering.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the following key components:
    +   Prediction using optimized clusters with Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
    +   Prediction using optimized clusters with the original dataset
    +   Selection of the best k-values for both methods
    +   Comparison of visualizations from both approaches to evaluate similarities
